The good news is that a ready-made UART module has been prepared for you. You only need to build a simple protocol on your development board that corresponds to the kitchen software, based on this module.

In this section, we will cover them all. \u4f60\u4eec\u8981\u505a\u7684\u662f\u4e86\u89e3\u600e\u4e48\u5199\u89e3\u91ca\u524d\u7684\u811a\u672c,\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba9\u5f00\u53d1\u677f\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u7684\u811a\u672c(\u673a\u5668\u7801). What you need to do is to read the specification, understand how to write the script before interpretation, and make the development board correctly execute the script after interpretation (machine code).","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"scripts/Introduction/#instruction-structure","text":"inst[15:8] inst[7:5] inst[4:3] inst[2:0] Name Immediate Number Signal Number Function Code Operation Code Alias i_num i_sign func op_code op_code \u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u800c func_code \u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 op_code is used to determine the basic type of the instruction, while func_code is used to determine the specific operation under a type. i_sign \u548c i_num \u5747\u662f\u6307\u4ee4\u4eec\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u6570. i_sign and i_num are the parameters required by the instructions.","title":"Instruction Structure"},{"location":"scripts/Introduction/#instruction-set","text":"\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cop_code\u548cfunc_code,\u6307\u4ee4\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7c7b\u578b: Depending on op_code and func_code, directives contain the following types: op(func) Format Description 001(00) get [i_num] Move to the machine with ID [inum], then get an item. 001(01) put [i_num] Move to the machine with ID [inum], then put an item. 001(10) interact [i_num] Move to the machine with ID [inum], then interact it. 001(11) throw [i_num] No need to move, throw item to machine with ID [inum]. 010(00) jumpif [i_num] [signal] Jump [i_num] lines if corresponding signal is 1. 010(01) jumpifn [i_num] [signal] Jump [i_num] lines if corresponding signal is 0. 011(00) wait [i_num] Wait about [inum]*100 ms. 011(01) wait [signal] Wait till corresponding signal is 1. 100(01) game start game should start. 100(10) game end game should over. \u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8bf7\u524d\u5f80\u5404\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u9875\u9762\u67e5\u770b.
